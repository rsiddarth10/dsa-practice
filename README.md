# DSA Practice 

This repository contains my **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** practice while preparing for **software engineering interviews**.

Problems are solved **topic-wise** with a focus on:
- Clear problem understanding
- Optimal approaches
- Clean and readable code
- Time and space complexity analysis

---

##  Topics Covered
- Arrays
- Strings
- Binary Search
- Linked List
- Stack & Queue
- Trees
- Graphs
- Dynamic Programming

(Topics will be added and expanded gradually.)

---

##  Approach
For each problem, I aim to:
1. Understand the core pattern involved
2. Implement an efficient solution
3. Add comments explaining the logic
4. Analyze time and space complexity


##  Note
This repository is meant for **learning and interview preparation**.  
Suggestions and discussions are always welcome.
